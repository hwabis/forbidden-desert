# forbidden-desert
hiatus until aug 17 lololol

(WIP!!!) - Play here: https://hwabis.github.io/forbidden-desert/

Created with boardgame.io and react; based off of Matt Leacock's Forbidden Desert board game.

Tile art source: various maps from https://maplestory.wiki/

## Rules
The official rules are [here](https://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/pdfs/Rules/ForbiddenDesertTM-RULES.pdf). This version has slight changes:

* Players can spawn on any tile, not just a regular equipment tile.
* Storm cards are not drawn from a deck, but randomly generated independently each turn. (Equipment is still drawn from a deck)
* Running out of sand markers is not a lose condition.
