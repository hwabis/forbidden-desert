Created with [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) and React; based off of Gamewright's Forbidden Desert board game, designed by Matt Leacock.

## Rules
The official rules are [here](https://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/pdfs/Rules/ForbiddenDesertTM-RULES.pdf). This version has slight changes:

* Storm cards are randomly generated each turn
* Running out of sand markers is not a lose condition
* You may have duplicate roles across different players (Yes, a team of only Meteorologists would be a guaranteed win, but that wouldn't be very fun...)
* Players can spawn on any tile, not just a regular equipment tile

Note that you cannot undo the excavate action and undo using any items.

An interesting gameplay restriction is to only allow communication between players who are on the same tile. à¶ž
