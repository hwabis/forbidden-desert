* Display win/loss

Play here: https://hwabis.github.io/forbidden-desert/ (storm currently disabled)

Created with [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) and React; based off of Gamewright's Forbidden Desert board game.

Tile art source: various maps from https://maplestory.wiki/

## Rules
The official rules are [here](https://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/pdfs/Rules/ForbiddenDesertTM-RULES.pdf). This version has slight changes:

* Players may only take moves on their own turns. (No using items or giving water during other players' turns)
* Players can spawn on any tile, not just a regular equipment tile.
* Storm cards are not drawn from a deck, but randomly generated independently each turn. (Equipment is still drawn from a deck. Meteorologists can't peak at the next storm cards)
* Running out of sand markers is not a lose condition.
* You may have duplicate roles across different players. (Yes, a full of Meteorologists would be a free win, but this is still gives more player freedom).
